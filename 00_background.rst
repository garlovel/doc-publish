About the Author
=============================

I am a semi-retired programmer from the world of DOS. I am informed and 
opinionated on politics and religion, and I lack the social filter to care if 
that offends anyone. So, stop reading if you are bothered.

I believe that politics should be practiced for social good, not personal 
reward. Good politics requires free speech, and free speech requires a free
press. Today and here, the Internet is free. This article demonstrates how to 
exercise your right to free (as in liberty) speech by publishing yourself for 
free (as in beer) on the Internet. 

Why Web Publishing?
=============================

That could be my story, but there are plenty of other reasons to want to 
publish yourself. As this guide demonstrates, publishing on the Internet is 
easy enough that any idiot can do it. 

Methods of Web Publishing
=============================

Several approaches to web publishing are available. The most common ways, and 
I have tried every one of them, might be:

+ Hand-coded HTML pages 
+ Articles served on a wiki such as MediaWiki
+ Content Management Systems: Drupal, joomla!, WordPress

Each of these publishing systems requires some element of system management:
having the right programming language version, upgrading the CMS, conflicts 
with SQL upgrades, and so forth. Content management varies by system and 
version, so document content becomes platform dependent. This brings us to ... 

Four Documentation Truths
=============================

Truth 1: Suffering.
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Publishing documentation content is suffering. For the author, website creation 
is suffering, domain management is suffering, hosting is suffering, server 
management is suffering, programming is suffering.

Truth 2: Attachment.
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Document presentation requires managing the mechanics of presentation. All 
document management systems are imperfect and impermanent manifestations of an 
authoring system ideal. The author desires to create content, and as authoring 
moves from writing content to managing systems, frustration with system 
imperfections produces suffering. But the root cause of this suffering is 
attachment to specific mechanisms of presentation.

Truth 3: Eliminate Desire.
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Eliminate the desire to control process, break the chain of attachment to 
document management systems, and publication suffering will end. Stop using 
publishing systems which require management; put the focus on content creation 
instead.

Truth 4: The Eight-Part Path.
